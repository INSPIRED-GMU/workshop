      <p class="py-6">The special theme for VL/HCC Conference 2022 is Human Centric AI.  Human. Centric.  AI.  Those three words are very paramount together and individually yet it is even more crucial and critical how we go about implementing, developing and designing AI technologies.  There is so much involved in the process which should not be taken lightly. It is imperative that we do not operate in a vacuum while discussing Human Centric AI.  Therefore, VL/HCC Conference offers a unique opportunity to gather a community of scholars to discuss how we centralize humanity within AI. </p>

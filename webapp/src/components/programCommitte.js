                  Dr. Felienne Hermans is associate professor at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science at Leiden University, where she heads the PERL research group, focused on programming education. On Saturdays she teaches children programming in a local community centre. She is one of the organizers of the CurryOn conference, which aims to bridge the gap between industry and academia. Felienne was also one of the founders of the Joy of Coding conference, with a similar goal, which she organized for 6 years. Since 2016, she has been a host at SE radio, one of the most popular software engineering podcasts on the web. When she is not coding, blogging or teaching, she is probably knitting, running or playing a (board)game.

                  Dr. Angela D. R. Smith’s research is in the field of human-computer interaction, computer supported cooperative work, and information sciences. Her current research studies how to more equitably design sociotechnical interventions to support the information work of homeless young adults residing within homeless shelter networks. Dr. Angela employs community-based participatory research and participatory design methods to construct knowledge and design interventions with her populations. This interdisciplinary work draws on a wide variety of work including information poverty, strength-based and asset-based approaches, as well as critical race theory and intersectionality.

Prior to receiving her Ph.D. in Technology & Social Behavior from Northwestern University, Dr. Angela has worked as an IT Consultant, Cybersecurity Analyst, as well as a UX Researcher for Airbnb and several startups.

                  Lelia is a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their research interests are (in no order) applied machine learning (e.g., global pandemics, climate justice, online harassment), Black feminist philosophy of AI, and AI safety (i.e. long tails, distribution shift, safe reinforcement learning, human-AI alignment). They are an MIT Presidential Fellow, Alfred P. Sloan Scholar, and Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) Scholar. Currently, they serve as the co-president of both the Black Graduate Student Association and the Academy of Courageous Minority Engineers. They have been a passionate volunteer and mentor for students from underrepresented minorities through their work in computer science teaching and mentoring programs, including Black Girls CODE, Technovation, Georgia Tech Catalyst, CodeHouse, and the Executive Board of MIT's Graduate Application Assistance Program (GAAP). To pursue their goal of computing for social good, they founded Blackathon and the Afrocomputing Collective.

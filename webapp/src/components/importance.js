        <p class="py-6">There are many ways to engage the human element in technical research, such as user studies and interviews. The goal for many of these kinds of studies, especially those that collect qualitative data, is to develop theories that can be applied in other contexts. The act of using research to posit theory is not as common in computing as it is in other non-technical domains, such as social and behavioral sciences. In fact, when we conduct research with the goal of posing a new theory, we often find that there is overlap between  existing social and behavioral  theories and phenomena in sociotechnical environments, such as software development teams. Furthermore, research that does not  involve human subjects runs the risk of conducting research and developing solutions that suggest its benefit, usefulness, or usability in practice. This is an especially important concern given the rapid adoption and use of complex technologies in software, such as artificial intelligence.
